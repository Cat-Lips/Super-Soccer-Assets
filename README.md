# F00F.Assets
Git Template for Godot Assets

Use this [template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template) to create a separate assets repo for your F00F projects.

## Usage:
 - (Optional) Update README.md
 - Add assets to subfolder of Assets
 - Add repo/path to setup.sh in parent project

## Why?
Assets increase time for git operations, so it makes sense to keep them in a separate repository.
Whether you keep history or not is up to you (history also increases checkout time).
